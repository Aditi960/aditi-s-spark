# Aditi Thakare — Web Developer Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built to present my skills, projects, and technical background as a **BCA student and aspiring Web Developer**.  
The goal of this project is straightforward: give recruiters a clear, fast overview of what I can build and how I approach real-world frontend development.

## About Me

I’m **Aditi Thakare**, a third-year **BCA student** focused on frontend and full-stack web development.  
I’m actively looking for **internship or entry-level roles** where I can contribute to real products, improve my engineering fundamentals, and grow through hands-on work.

This portfolio reflects practical skills, not tutorial-level experiments.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build a production-grade React application using TypeScript
- Structure code for maintainability and scalability
- Use modern UI libraries instead of custom hacks
- Handle form validation and async data properly
- Integrate frontend applications with a real backend service
- Deploy and maintain a live application

It reflects how I would approach frontend work in a professional environment.
